    <p> Just over a year ago, we became fascinated by the idea of discovering the perfect rice. <br></br>What if rice was more than just carbohydrates? What if there's nothing more to life than rice? <br></br>It may sound crazy, but we wanted to build the closest thing to the perfect rice cooker. <br></br>While there are many ways to discover events and places, we realised there is no better way to experience life right now than through eating rice. <br></br>A picture is said to be worth a thousand words, but rice provides an out of the world experience.
<br></br>And that's where our rice cooker begins.

    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;"> OUR PROMISE </h3> <!-- Creating the title for the 4th box -->
    <br></br> <!-- Breaks -->
    <p> I graduated from the University of Northumbria in Rice Engineering before studying Rice Management at Liverpool Hope University, I then embarked on my Rice Cooker career in the North East of England, where I became Head of Rice Quality in my second year. <br></br>
    I spent nine years as Head of Rice Quality before becoming Head of Rice Bags and taking up several rice responsibilities. <br></br>
    I joined here in 2013 as Assistant CEO, and I am now CEO, Head of Rice Cookers. My focus is on ensuring all rice cookers are perfected. It is my absolute pleasure to work in an environment that really does promotes 'Nothing more to life than rice'.
